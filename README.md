# MySQLReact

 This project was made on my learning process on implementing SQL Database in ReactJS. In this project include some functions such MySQL Database connection and basic CRUD operation implemented in ReactJS.

 To run this project, you need Visual Studio Code, XAMPP and NodeJS.

 After all the software installed, you need to change your directory to backend in your terminal and run this script.

 "npm install" or "npm i"

 This script will install all of package that has been used to run this project such as express, mysql and cors.

 After completed on backend you need to do the same step on frontend side to install package such axios, bootstrap and so on.

 I hope by share this repo to public might help others who wanted to learn SQL and ReactJS can gain something.
